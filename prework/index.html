        Every tale begins with a journey…and if you don't my mind, I’ll introduce you to mine.
        My love for computer technology began at an early age. I was the subject matter expert in my family when it came to questions about computers. At nine years old, I was dismantling computers, TVs, radios and hard drives to see what was inside. Sometimes, I was able to fix damaged computers without even knowing what I was doing. During high school I had the opportunity to oversee the computer lab and provided desktop support and maintenance, troubleshooting and addressed general computer issues.
        When it was time to decide on a major for college, the same curiosity and passion remained and I chose Cyber Security. Fascinated by hackers and how they utilized computer flaws to take control of networks and computers systems, prompted me to learn more about this field, so I can be able to scrutinize the subtleties behind hacking and everything related to it.
        My areas of focus are cyber security, digital forensic, vulnerability testing and have knowledge of Nessus, Qradar, Anomaly, Data Recovery, and static malware analysis.
