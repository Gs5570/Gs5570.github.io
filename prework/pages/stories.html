    <h1>Coming to the states </h1>
    <p id = "paragraphFont">As a child growing up, my aim and objectives were to come to America and go to school to achieve something better in future. Moving from my country to come to the U.S changed my whole life because it was my dream. I came to the United States at the age of 22 and I’m 25 years of age now. Writing this essay felt like a walk down memory lane. Although I’ve not been here for a long time, it has changed my life and I still have many accomplishments and goals to achieve in this life. Leaving your country is always a difficult decision and whoever has been in that shoe before would know what I’m talking about.
